Intro to Business Data Analytics

This course is an introduction to data analytics and its role in business. We will examine how data analysis technologies can be used to improve decision-making. We will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining, with real-world examples and cases to place data-mining techniques in context, to develop data-analytic thinking, and to illustrate that proper application is as much an art as it is a science.
